# Next.js TMDB Movie App

This is a simple Next.js application that fetches and displays movies from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. The app allows users to view a list of movies, details, and images sourced from TMDB.

## Features

- Fetches movie data from TMDB API.
- Displays movie titles, images, and release dates.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nextjs-tmdb-movie-app.git
cd nextjs-tmdb-movie-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install the necessary dependencies using npm or Yarn.

With npm:

```bash
npm install
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Get TMDB API Key

You will need a TMDB API key to fetch the data. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Go to the [TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Create an account (or log in if you already have one).
3. Visit the [API section](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and generate a new API key.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your TMDB API bearer token.

```env
MOVIE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with the actual token you got from TMDB.

### 5. Run the Development Server

Now that youâ€™ve installed the dependencies and set up your environment, you can start the development server.

With npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 6. Build and Deploy

If you want to build the application for production:

With npm:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

You can then deploy the app to platforms like Vercel or Netlify for easy deployment.
